### What is ChordCore?

 [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/chordcore/chordcore.github.io/edit/main/README.md) 

ChordCore is a free piano education software for beginners who are just starting to learn the first chords, and experts who aim to broaden their knowledge or just exercise. The main purpose of the software is to provide a fast and graphical way to interpret the chords for music. These days the internet is full of openly available chord/lyrics texts for most songs. The majority of these texts are mainly for the support of guitar players by showing them the correct guitar tabs. ChordCore can decode these texts on a built-in virtual piano keyboard, with the added choice to explore chord progressions. It is possible to record, playback and even save the tempo of chord changes which helps with learning complex music. With a few clicks, you can correct, improve or transpose the chords using the built-in chord definitions. ChordCore can interpret all known chord types and alternate chord symbols, but in case of personal needs, the database is easily updatable.

### For Beginners

You will learn how to play chords easily without the knowledge of reading sheet music. You will learn how to build and play major, minor, seventh, augmented, diminished, suspended, extended chords on the piano. You will learn how to use chord formulas and their benefits. One of the tool’s capabilities is the reverse chord finder to find chord names that have a specific set of notes. By using a built-in virtual piano or dynamic text editor, the chords can be played with one out of five selectable MIDI instruments. It is possible to use high-quality sound fonts instead of general MIDI instruments to reach professional, studio-level sounding. You can even connect and pair your external MIDI Keyboard to ChordCore for improved comfort. Finally, you can export the used chords chart to PDF document.

### For Professionals

With ChordCore you can write down the lyrics and chords of your song to achieve the wished chord progression. You can explore the set of extended chords common in jazz, funk, and R&B. If you are a musician but not familiar with chord symbol interpretation, ChordCore can help you with this too. Even singers can find ChordCore useful by having straight chord accompaniment in the best possible key.
